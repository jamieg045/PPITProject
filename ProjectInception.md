# Project Inception Stage
Main Idea:
An E-Commerce mobile application for restaurants & bars that let the user input their food and drink into the application and have the staff members recieve the data.

Functionality:
* Shopping cart style functionality letting user raise or lower number of products and price range increasing or decreasing as a result.
* Payment method functionality using possibly PayPal API that allows users to purchase what products are in their cart.
* Lets the user choose their table from a list or a view of tables all numbered.
* A login system that takes into account user and password variables and stores the information on the cloud in a database (MongoDB or MySQL)

Frameworks & Software:
As of right now there is no set framework on which to start the project off on yet, the main ones I have researched are:
* Ionic
* Angular
* As Brian suggested at our meeting using a MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) or MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) stack format which I think would be very beneficial.

There is more research to be done on this front but as of right now the idea and the functionality is there. All to narrow down is the framework & software to be used within the application.
