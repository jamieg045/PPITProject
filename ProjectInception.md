# Project Inception Stage
Main Idea:
An E-Commerce mobile application for restaurants & bars that let the user input their food and drink into the application and have the staff members recieve the data.

Functionality:
* Shopping cart style functionality letting user raise or lower number of products and price range increasing or decreasing as a result.
* Payment method functionality using possibly PayPal API that allows users to purchase what products are in their cart.
* Lets the user choose their table from a list or a view of tables all numbered.
* A login system that takes into account user and password variables and stores the information on the cloud in a database (MongoDB or MySQL)

Frameworks & Software:
As of right now there is no set framework on which to start the project off on yet, the main ones I have researched are:
* Ionic
* Angular
* As Brian suggested at our meeting using a MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) or MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) stack format which I think would be very beneficial.

There is more research to be done on this front but as of right now the idea and the functionality is there. All to narrow down is the framework & software to be used within the application.

# 02/03/2023
As of this week I have just started on the code aspect of the project. My commits to Github are rather small and the code content very very simplistic but that is what I was planning so that there is a structure to the project and the content within. I've created an Angular application installing Express and Mongoose in line with the MEAN stack which I already have Node.js installed on my operating system. I have created so far a single-page application which takes in two components, the cart and products and outputs them along with the main page of the application. In committing to the repository I ran into a number of issues as I created the project in a seperate folder to the one I had my very first commit so I could not commit my created application to the repository until I merged all the changes. In doing so I added the README and the ProjectInception files to the application folder and deleted the existing files on GitHub and pushed the changes so for all intents and purposes, the same files still exist but have been merged and the commit messages will verify this also.
